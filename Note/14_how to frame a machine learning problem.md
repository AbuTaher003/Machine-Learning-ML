### Framing a Machine Learning Problem for a Business Scenario

This guide outlines the steps to frame a machine learning problem effectively in a business context.

### 1. Understand the Business Objective

Clearly define what the business wants to achieve. Examples:
- Increase revenue.
- Reduce customer churn.
- Optimize operational processes.
- Predict customer behavior to enhance decision-making.

### 2. Identify the Data Sources

Determine the data required to address the business objective. Examples:
- Sales data.
- Customer feedback.
- Operational metrics.
- External datasets (if relevant).

### 3. Define the Target Variable

Decide what the machine learning model should predict or classify. Examples:
- Will a customer make a purchase?
- How much revenue will a product generate?
- Which customers are at risk of churning?

### 4. Formulate as an ML Problem

Structure the problem into one of the following types:
- **Regression**: For predicting continuous numerical values (e.g., sales predictions).
- **Classification**: For predicting categories (e.g., churn: yes/no).
- **Clustering**: For grouping data based on similarity (e.g., customer segmentation).

### 5. Specify Evaluation Metrics

Define how the model‚Äôs success will be measured. Examples:
- **Accuracy**: For classification problems.
- **F1 Score**: For imbalanced datasets.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: For regression problems.
- **Precision and Recall**: To evaluate trade-offs between false positives and negatives.

This framework ensures that the machine learning problem is well-defined and aligned with business objectives for maximum impact.
